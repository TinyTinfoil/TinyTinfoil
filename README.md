- Hi, I’m TinyTinfoil 
- I’m interested in firmware, hardware and how they combine with software and systems. Especially for low noise systems.
- I’m currently trying to find a summer internship for 2025 in electrical engineering.
- "How to reach me?" – I can be found on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@TinyTinfoil)
