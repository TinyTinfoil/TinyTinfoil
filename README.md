- Hi, I’m TinyTinfoil 
- I’m interested in Javascript, Elasticsearch, rclone, PWAs, and timeboxing/productivity software and systems.
- I’m currently learning React and revisiting nginx, plus porting some stuff to React Native for an accessibility project of mine.
- "How to reach me?" – Make a pull request on my github.io site and I'll find it.
